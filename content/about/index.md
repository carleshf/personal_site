## Trajectory

I am a researcher at the [Analysis Grup](https://cnag.es/teams/bioinformatics-unit/data-analysis) (from Bioinformatics' Unit) from the [Centre Nacional d’Anàlisi Genòmica](https://www.cnag.crg.eu). I mainly work as a data engineer developing and improving pipelines for genomic and genomic-related data analyses. I also work as a software developer by creating new software for, mainly, genomic and clinic data analysis.

Before working at the Centre Nacional d’Anàlisi Genòmica, my research interests included the study of the relations between environmental factors and internal omic perturbations, development of applications to integrate multiple layers of omic data-sets and web development of databases. Therefore, I have previously been at the Computational Health Informatics Program, located at [Boston Children’s Hospital](https://www.childrenshospital.org) and the [Pediatrics Department](https://connects.catalyst.harvard.edu/Profiles/display/Person/171981) of the Harvard Medical School, as a research fellow elucidating the relationship between environmental factors and autism severity. Before, I performed my Ph.D. thesis at the [Bioinformatic Research Group in Epidemiology](http://brge.isglobal.org/) from [Barcelona Institute for Global Health](https://www.isglobal.org/) depicting the impact of ultraviolet light (UV-A + UV-B) on human health, as well as working as a bioinformatic analyst studying the impact of multiple environmental factors on human internal molecular signatures (also known as omic data, including methylome, transcriptome, proteome, and metabolome).

Previously turning into research, I studied my bachelor in Computer Sciences at Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona, as well as my master in Bioinformatics, and worked as a computer engineer and as a software developer elsewhere.
