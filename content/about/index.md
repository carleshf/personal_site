## Short Bio

I am a software developer, former researcher and bioinformatics analyst, at the Bioinformatics Unit from the [Centre Nacional d'Anàlisi Genòmica](https://www.cnag.crg.eu).

Before turning into software development, my research interests include the study of the relations between environmental factors and internal omic perturbations, development of applications to integrate multiple layers of omic data-sets and web development of databases. I have previously been at the Computational Health Informatics Program, located at [Boston Children’s Hospital](https://www.childrenshospital.org) and at the [Pediatrics Department](https://connects.catalyst.harvard.edu/Profiles/display/Person/171981) of the Harvard Medical School, as a research fellow and at the [Bioinformatic Research Group in Epidemiology](http://brge.isglobal.org/) from [Barcelona Institute for Global Health]("https://www.isglobal.org/) as bioinformatic analyst.
