Like the previous years, I continued with the tradition of sending a geed Winter Card to my workmates.

This year I wrote it in R since it is one of the most used languages at my workplace, CREAL.

The result of running the script I sent (just a source code that loaded a file on the cloud) is seen above. The source code for that can be found at my christmas-card's github ([link](https://github.com/carleshf/christmasCards)) as `mc201415.R`.
