It's time for the _geek christmas card_. This year I wrote it in JAVA, and it can generate, randomly, one of four different outputs.

It is the simplest card I coded but I made it thinking in simplicity.

The source code for that can be found at my christmas-card's github ([link](https://github.com/carleshf/christmasCards)), inside the folder `mc201516`. If you take care, you will find a two-output version of this card coded in R 😁.
