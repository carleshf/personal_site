Following the tradition, I've made the _geek christmas card_ for this year. As it is being the trend lately, it is coded in _javascript_ and _HTML5_.

{{< figure src="/img/wc201819.png" caption="Winter card 2018 - 2019: Mike has lost his presents for Santaclaus!" link="https://carleshf.itch.io/mc201819" >}}

The card is, again, a _minigame_ where Mike 'the elf' has lost the present he crafter for this Christmas and we need to help him to find them all.
