This past year has been a really significant one with many challenges. Therefore I wanted to make a winter card that shows the opposite: _simplicity_, _elegance_, and _joy_.

So, the winter card it is juts a snowing page that allows you to discover your present, from a possible random set of 35 different drawings.

You can play it clicking the previous picture and the code of this card [here](https://github.com/carleshf/christmasCards).
