For this Christmas, I wanted to move the level of the _geek christmas card_ further that I did before.

The previous _gamified GCCs_ were based on a couple of smartphone games. For instance, the one for [2018-2019]({{< ref "/fun/winter_card_2018-2019.md" >}}) was based on a game called _[Tomb of the Mask](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.playgendary.tom&hl=en)_ and the first on I _gamified_, [2016-2017]({{< ref "/fun/winter_card_2016-2017.md" >}}), was based on _[FlappyBird](https://flappybird.io/)_.

This time I wanted to come back in time and bring back an old point-and-click game-system that I played in _[Where in the world is Carmen Sandiego?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmen_Sandiego#Where_in_the_World_Is_Carmen_Sandiego?_(1985,_1996))_ and _[Where in the space is Carmen Sandiego?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmen_Sandiego#Where_in_Space_Is_Carmen_Sandiego?_(1993))_.

So, for this year I codded the __Who stole the Christmas from Noth Pole?.__ It follows the same rules as the _Carmen Sandiego'_ games and the goal is to collect the clues to identify the thief as well as to be in the city he/she is hiding.
