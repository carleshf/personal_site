This year I've decided to send a Christmas' card to my classmates. And since we are a bunch a little geeks, and I'm not an exception, here you have the postcard I sent them: _A source-code-postcard in python_.

The result of running the script is this:

{{< figure src="/img/wc201213.png" caption="Winter card 2012 - 2013: snowflake" >}}

You can see the gallery of cards [here](https://carleshf.github.io/christmasCards/) and you have the source code [here](https://github.com/carleshf/christmasCards).
