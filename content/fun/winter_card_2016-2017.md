Following the tradition of the last years, I've made a _geek christmas card:. This year I typed it in _javascript_ using the improvements of _HTML5_.

{{< figure src="/img/wc201617.png" caption="Winter card 2016 - 2017: Mr Snowman has lost his hat!" link="https://carleshf.itch.io/mc201617" >}}

The card is a _minigame_ where a small and blue snowman has lost his hat and you need to help him to recover it. The characteristic of the game is that the snowman moves autonomously once the user gave him a direction. The blue guy moves along the gray platforms until it bounces with the orange corners or falls outside the game. Later the user can make him jump by pressing _space-bar_.

Make a click on the picture to play the game. The source code is [here](https://github.com/carleshf/christmasCards).
