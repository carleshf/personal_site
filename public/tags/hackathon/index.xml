      <description>On Saturday, June 1st 2019, I attended the hackathon Code for Care organized by Humana Experience Center, at the District Hall (Boston, MA).
The goal of that hackathon was to build a digital software to help [not-necessary] elderly to manage their medications, taking special attention to those individuals with comorbidities (the simultaneous presence of two chronic diseases or conditions in the same individual).
There was no limitation in type of software nor in technology we could use for the development, although we were encouraged to use the FDAâ€™s free drug data API, that provides access to data like adverse events, product labeling, and a full directory of all NDCs (National Drug Codes).</description>
