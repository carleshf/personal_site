      <description>This past year has been a really significant one with many challenges. Therefore I wanted to make a winter card that shows the opposite: simplicity, elegance, and, specially, joy.

      <description>For this Christmas, I wanted to move the level of the geek christmas card further that I did before.
The previous gamified GCCs were based on a couple of smartphone games. For instance, the one for 2018-2019 was based on a game called Tomb of the Mask and the first on I gamified, 2016-2017, was based on FlappyBird.
This time I wanted to come back in time and bring back an old point-and-click game-system that I played in Where in the world is Carmen Sandiego?</description>

      <description>Following the tradition, I&amp;rsquo;ve made the geek christmas card for this year. As it is being the trend lately, it is coded in javascript and HTML5.

      <description>It is the time to follow the tradition of creating a geek christmas card. As I did last year, the one for this year I typed it in javascript. It is much simpler compared to the game of the 2016 Christmas, but I enjoyed coding it.
No picture this time, only the link to it: Merry Christmas 2017-2018.
The card is an HTML5 canvas used as a grid where different pixelled cartoons appear being drawn pixel-a-pixel.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s time for the geek christmas card. This year I wrote it in JAVA, and it can generate, randomly, one of four different outputs.
It is the simplest card I coded but I made it thinking in simplicity.
